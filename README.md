## How to run

## STILL IN WORK, NOT DONE YET !!!


Future usage:
Run this commands in command line from root of directory
```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. && make
```

Write `make test` to run sample. To run your own program use executable `compiler` with your code:

```./compiler a.in```

## ToDo
 * Comments
 * Extra classes for non-terminals
 * Some necessary improvements
